# Ibanity Ruby Library

The Ibanity Ruby Library provides convenient wrappers around the Ibanity API. The object attributes are dynamically defined based on the API response, supporting minor API changes seamlessly.

Supported API version per product:

Product | Version
-- | --

Ponto Connect | 1

Consent | 1

In case you need to connect to an older version of an API, please consult `CHANGELOG.md` for more info on which version of the gem supports which version of the API.
